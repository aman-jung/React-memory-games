Bird Matching is a simple project which is developed using react . I made use of class component for this project.

There are 6 Components in this project .

- App component - Its the main component of the page
- Array component - It consists of all the images.
- Card component - It is used to display all the cards whether it is opened or not.
- Clock component - It consists of the timer logic that need to be displays
- Moves component - It consists of all the moves when the user clicks the images

## What i have built
- I have built a bird matching game in react. 
- User is allowed to click only two images at a time . 
- At first all the images is disabled (and seen as white screen). Once the image is click it is enabled and displayed. 
- User can click two images i.e. if two images clicked is same then enable it and increment the count otherwise disable it
